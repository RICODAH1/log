# Day 29

Today I almost finished my last project for freeCodeCamp RWD cert, the Personal Portfolio Page. I am having some issues with there being a small border around the whole flex item, which I cannot remove. It isnt really a border, more like the body has a white background and the flex-wrapper inside is the site layout.
