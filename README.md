# Log of 100 Day of Code Challenge

Log of my 100 Day of Code Challenge

I started this log a little late, day 12 to be exact. I have been tweeting about my progress daily since the beginning. My goal is to get fluent in HTML and CSS and JS if I can fit it in in the 100 days, if not then theres always next round.
