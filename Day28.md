# Day 28

Today  I started the freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio project, which is the last one for the Responsive Web Design Certificate. I completed all the user stories and the site is 100% mobile friendly, tomorrow I will decide the color scheme and do the final touches.It has been a good day, I barely struggled with flexbox!
